        <p class="smalled">The education Act was introduced in the year 1835. Lord William Bentinck, then Governor-General of the British East India Company, decided in 1835 to reallocate funds needed by the British Parliament to spend on education and literature in India, and the Act of the Council of India gave effect to his decision.
            They had previously provided very minimal support for traditional Muslim and Hindu education, as well as the dissemination of literature in India's then-traditional languages of learning (Sanskrit and Persian); they were to assist establishments that taught a Western curriculum using English as the medium of instruction going forward.

    <p class="text-big">What is Education?</p>
    <p class="smalled">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>
